This repository contains my submission for DataCamp's Data Analyst Professional  Practical Exam

## Business Solution
#### Definition of a metric for the business to monitor 

The best metric for the business to monitor in this situation and with the data given is a productivity index which is equals to``` The Revenue generated from sales method divided by (/) time spent on the sales method```. Tracking sales revenue can provide insights into the effectiveness of marketing and sales strategies, as well as how well products are performing in the market. Tracking the time can provide insights into which method is the most productive with the least amount of time. 

#### How should the business use the metric to monitor the business problem?
The comparison between the Sales method and revenue gotten would tell a clear story on which sales method would be the best to use considering the time put into the execution of each method.

#### Can you estimate initial value(s) for the metric based on the current data?
Based on the current data, The average revenue from Call is 47.60, Email is 97.13 and Email + Call is 183.65. Given that Call takes 30 minutes and the call in the Email + Call method takes 10 minutes and assuming that sending each email takes 5 minutes 

| Sales Method 	| Average Revenue 	| Time Taken    	| Productivity Index 	|
|--------------	|-----------------	|---------------	|--------------------	|
| Call         	| 47.60           	| 30            	| 1.59               	|
| Email        	| 97.13           	| 10 (2 emails) 	| 9.71               	|
| Email + Call 	| 183.65          	| 15            	| 12.2               	|

The most productive method is the Email + Call method. Considering the Average Revenue generated and the amount of effort put into by the sales team

## Summary of findings
- The highest number of new products sold at a time is 16 and the highest revenue gotten from products sold to a customer is 238.32 with 16 items bought 
- The top five location of the customers are California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois
- The combination of email and call method of sale sold more new products and created more revenue despite the combination being the least used.
- Week 1 has a higher count of customers followed by week 4, 5, 2, 3 and 6. However, this doesn't determine much as the revenue increases as the weeks since product launch goes by making week 6 have the highest revenue. This pattern is also seen with the number of items sold. More items are sold in the later weeks.
- Years as a customer does not determine the number of site visits
- Customers that buy more and generate more revenue are new customers. Older customers tend to buy less and this can also be due to the fact that there are fewer customers that have over 20 years as customers.  

## Conclusion and Recommendations
- Considering that the combination of Email and Call produces the most revenue and is the most productive according to the defined metric, Pens and Printers should intensify their efforts in the sales method of Email and Call
- Since the most sales and revenue from products are gotten 4-6 weeks after the lunch of the product, this would indicate that the products are bought after the second reminder which could be the email or call. Pens and Printers should make an effort to remind customers earlier
- As older customers tend to buy less, There should be some sort of incentive or promo run to reinitiate the interest of older customers
